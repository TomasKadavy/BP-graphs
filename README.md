# Bachelor thesis
The overall application consists of two parts. The first one is a backend implemented in Java Spring that transforms the available data into process graphs using the process mining library called PM4Py. The second part is a frontend implementation using Angular technology, which dynamically displays these otherwise static graphs on the web using the svgson library. I have also created a docker instalation.
